    "A binary tree is an ordered tree with the following properties:\n",
    "1. Every node has at most two children.\n",
    "2. Each child node is labeled as being either a left child or a right child.\n",
    "3. A left child precedes a right child in the order of children of a node.\n",

    "### 二叉树的链式存储结构\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural way to realize a binary tree T is to use a linked structure, with a node(see Figure 8.11a) that maintains references to the element stored at a position p and to the nodes associated with the children and parent of p. If p is the root of T, then the parent field of p is None. Likewise, if p does not have a left child (respectively, right child), the associated field is None. The tree itself maintains an instance variable storing a reference to the root node (if any), and a variable, called size, that represents the overall number of nodes of T. We show such a linked structure representation of a binary tree in Figure 8.11b.\n",
