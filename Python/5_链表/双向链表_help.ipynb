    "&emsp;&emsp;To provide greater symmetry, we define a linked list in which each node keeps an explicit reference to the node before it and a reference to the node after it. Such a structure is known as a doubly linked list. These lists allow a greater variety of O(1)-time update operations, including insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions within the list. We continue to use the term “next” for the reference to the node that follows another, and we introduce the term “prev” for the reference to the node that precedes it.\n",

    "&emsp;&emsp;In order to avoid some special cases when operating near the boundaries of a doubly linked list, it helps to add special nodes at both ends of the list: a header node at the beginning of the list, and a trailer node at the end of the list. These “dummy” nodes are known as sentinels (or guards), and they do not store elements of the primary sequence. A doubly linked list with such sentinels is shown in Figure below\n",

    "&emsp;&emsp;When using sentinel nodes, an empty list is initialized so that the next field of the header points to the trailer, and the prev field of the trailer points to the header; the remaining fields of the sentinels are irrelevant (presumably None, in Python). For a nonempty list, the header’s next will refer to a node containing the first real element of a sequence, just as the trailer’s prev references the node containing the\n",

    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;Although we could implement a doubly linked list without sentinel nodes (as we did with our singly linked list), the slight extra space devoted to the sentinels greatly simplifies the logic of our operations. Most notably, the header and trailer nodes never change—only the nodes between them change. Furthermore, we can treat all insertions in a unified manner, because a new node will always be\n",
